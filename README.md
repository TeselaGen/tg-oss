# Running tests

Unit tests are run automatically via precommit hook that runs a `bun test` command at the top level

Cypress e2e tests can be run locally via the following commands:
`nx run ove:launch-e2e`
`nx run ui:launch-e2e`

CI is run via GitHub Actions on every push and pull request and runs a suite of Cypress e2e tests
